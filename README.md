# Employee Tracker

## Developement

This application enables a user to create their own employee tracker using a basic Node.js application. A user is able to add and view employees, roles, and departments. A user is also able to update an employee's role. All data that the user has entered or manipulated is continually synced to a local MySQL database for easy integration with other systems.

Additionally, a schema file and seed SQL file are present in the repository can be used to set up the database and tables.

### Below are screenshots of the deplyed application:
